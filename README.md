BrainSMASH
==========

BrainSMASH (Brain Surrogate Maps with Spatially Autocorrelated Heterogeneity) is a 
python-based computational platform for statistical testing of spatially
autocorrelated brain maps. At the core of BrainSMASH is functionality to 
simulate surrogate brain maps with spatial autocorrelation that is matched
to the spatial autocorrelation in an empirical map. BrainSMASH also includes
additional utilities to support gene ontology enrichment analyses and automated
illustration of brain maps using Connectome Workbench.
